        <p>Design[edit]
The 3310 was developed at the Copenhagen Nokia site in Denmark. It is a compact and sturdy phone featuring an 84 Ã— 48 pixel pure monochrome display.[1] It has a lighter 115 g battery variant which has fewer features; for example the 133 g battery version has the start-up image of two hands touching while the 115 g version does not. It is a slightly rounded rectangular unit that is typically held in the palm of a hand, with the buttons operated with the thumb. The blue button is the main button for selecting options, with "C" button as a "backspace", "back" or "undo" button.[1] Up and down buttons are used for navigation purposes. The on/off/profile button is a stiff black button located on the top of the phone.

The 3310 is known for being reasonably durable due to its casing and construction, a feature which is often humorously exaggerated in online communities.[6] Numerous videos also exist of the phone being put through damage tests to test the phone's strength, including being dropped from a great height and being crushed by heavy objects, many times of which the phone proved its record.[7]

Features[edit]
The 3310 is known for having many features that were rare for the time. These include many utilities, such as a calculator, Nokia network monitor, stop watch and a reminder function. It has four games: Pairs II, Space Impact, Bantumi, and the hugely popular Snake II. The Snake series of games had been popular on Nokia handsets since the late 1990s.[8] CNET remembered Space Impact, a shoot 'em up in which the player fires projectiles at oncoming aliens, as a mediocre game overall but impressive for fitting a mobile device with its complexity and length.[9] It was later recreated for other mobile devices.[10] The Telegraph said that the phone was remembered for its games.[11]

The 3310 was popular for SMS text messaging because it allowed long messages three times the size of a standard SMS text message, at 459 characters. It also featured threaded SMS writing and SMS Chat. The phone also has voice dialing for the quick dialing of selected numbers.[8]
